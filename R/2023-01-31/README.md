# Pet Cats UK

The data this week comes from the [Movebank for Animal Tracking Data](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.882) via [Data is Plural](https://themarkup.org/data-is-plural/2023/01/25/from-jazz-solos-to-cats-on-the-move#:~:text=Giuseppe%20Sollazzo%5D-,Cats%20on%20the%20move,-.%20Between%202013). Thanks @jthomasmock for the suggestion!

> Between 2013 and 2017, Roland Kays et al. convinced hundreds of volunteers in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and New Zealand to strap GPS sensors on their pet cats. The aforelinked datasets include each cat’s characteristics (such as age, sex, neuter status, hunting habits) and time-stamped GPS pings.

Additional datasets for the [US](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.885), [Australia](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.876), and [New Zealand](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.879) are also available for download, but they were too large for us to include them directly.
