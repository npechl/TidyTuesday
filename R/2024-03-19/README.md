# X-Men Mutant Moneyball

This week's data is [X-Men Mutant Moneyball](https://github.com/EliCash82/mutantmoneyball) from Rally's [Mutant moneyball: a data driven ultimate X-men](https://rallyrd.com/mutant-moneyball-a-data-driven-ultimate-x-men/) by [Anderson Evans](https://github.com/EliCash82). 

This is the data used in Rally's Mutant Moneyball article which visualizes X-Men value data, era by era, from the X-Men's creation in 1963 up to 1993. The idea is that the the concepts in Michael Lewis' book [Moneyball](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1301), can be applied in a number of cultural industries, not just baseball like in the book and [the movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)).

>It’s no accident that the name of this piece is Mutant Moneyball, as the overall point is an exercise in valuing each individual character on the X-Men team in a variety of data driven ways. But buying, reading, and loving comic books should be purely for fun and the raw expression of devotion toward characters, art, and story. True: It’s a lesson we fans have failed to learn in the past. The trend of buying comics based on value speculation crippled the entire comic book industry for over a decade in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s. And the point of this isn’t to repeat those mistakes, it’s to gamify open and available financial data, giving us special insight, once unattainable, regarding our magnificent mutants. Like mature adults. 

>Why are some characters sought after more than others, what stories did some mighty mutants convey that made them sought after, while others that eek out a continued existence are unable to resonate enough with a fan base to garner the same kind of love and appreciation in the secondary market? Are there answers that a close reading of value data can offer?

Dollar signs and percentage signs are in the data for some of the columns. Which columns are they in? Do you need to address that before you work with the data in those columns?
