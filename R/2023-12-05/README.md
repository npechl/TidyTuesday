# Life Expectancy

Our World in Data released a [new report on life expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy), and analysis and interpretations are making the rounds this week, and you can join in too! 

We had a dataset on Global Life Expectancy on [2018-07-03](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018#readme), so if you're a long time tidytuesday-er, this is a chance for some new analyses. 

The data this week comes the [Our World in Data Life Expectancy report](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy), specifically the figures in the [key insights](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#key-insights) section. The source for this data is from United Nations World Population Prospects (2022); Human Mortality Database (2023); Zijdeman, Richard and Filipa Ribeira da Silva (2015), [Life Expectancy at Birth (Total)](http://hdl.handle.net/10622/LKYT5); Riley, J.C.

>Across the world, people are living longer.
In 1900, the average life expectancy of a newborn was 32 years. By 2021 this had more than doubled to 71 years.
But where, when, how, and why has this dramatic change occurred?
To understand it, we can look at data on life expectancy worldwide.
The large reduction in child mortality has played an important role in increasing life expectancy. But life expectancy has increased at all ages. Infants, children, adults, and the elderly are all less likely to die than in the past, and death is being delayed.
This remarkable shift results from advances in medicine, public health, and living standards. Along with it, many predictions of the ‘limit’ of life expectancy have been broken.
On the Our World in Data Life Expectancy page, you will find global data and research on life expectancy and related measures of longevity: the probability of death at a given age, the sex gap in life expectancy, lifespan inequality within countries, and more.
