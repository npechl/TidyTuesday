# Chess Game Dataset (Lichess)

The chess dataset this week comes from Lichess.org via [Kaggle/Mitchell J](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess/data).

> This is a set of just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users on the site Lichess.org.

Use the data to explore -

1. What the common opening moves? By ranks?
2. How many turns does a game last based on player ranking?
3. What move patterns explain the game outcome?

Thank you to [Havisha Khurana](https://github.com/havishak) for curating this week's dataset.
